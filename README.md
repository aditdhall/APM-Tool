Application-Performance-Monitoring (APM Tool)

This project was about collecting data about computer system processes. The data I collected utilized CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. I also collected hard disk access rate speed and hard disk utilization. Collecting data such as this helps troubleshoot various problems a user may have when dealing with computer hardware, software, and networking. Tracking all the data down to seconds means that users can see precisely when and how much of a computerâ€™s resources are getting used on each task.
